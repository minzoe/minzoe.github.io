            <p>When God had made the earth and sky,<br>
                The flowers and the trees,<br>
                He then made all the animals,<br>
                The fish, the birds and bees.</p>
            
            <p>And when at last He'd finished,<br>
                Not one was quite the same,<br>
                God said, <em>"I'll walk this earth of mine,<br>
                And give each one a name."</em></p>
            
            <p>And so He traveled far and wide,<br>
                And everywhere He went,<br>
                A little creature followed Him,<br>
                Until its strength was spent.</p>
            
            <p>When all were named upon the earth,<br>
                And in the sky and sea,<br>
                The little creature said,<br>
                <em>"Dear Lord, There's not one left for me."</em></p>
            
            <p>Kindly the Father said to him,<br>
                <em>"I've left you to the end,<br>
                I've turned my own name back to front,<br>
                And call you DOG, my friend."</em></p>
