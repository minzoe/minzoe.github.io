            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>I was tasked with outside the need for homework to use my phone when viewing webpages. Unfortuanely for the assignmnet I only used needed to view one site.</p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>I was still able to see what I needed to. I used My Fridge Food to look up a recipe for a cake in a mug. I was still able to search my ingredients, like on the desktop version.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>The results page from my search for a recipe was setup as a list. It was difficult to scroll through the results, but I found a recipe still.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>I was able to find a recipe fairly quickly and reading the instructions was not difficult like other sites I have view previously.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>The main problem was that every page was slow to load.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>I like being able to look up recipes on my phone versus desktop, because my phone is more moveable, but My Fidge food is not a reccomened site for mobile.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I learned that while it might be perferd for a service to be delievered no mobile it is not always the best format for it. I was surprised on how difficult going throught the results were. It was a lot to look through a too small screen.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
